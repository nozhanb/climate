I separated the functions in index.py. Now we have iceReader and energyReader.
I need to check a few things. I still need to check the lat = 90 and make sure
what is going on in lat = 90 exactly for both functions.
 
I need to test the average part of the 
iceReader function. I replace all the NAN values of the ice fraction by 0 and 
now I am adding more numbers while there are no numbers there and it effects 
average. First, I need to make sure if there are any ---/NAN values in the file.
If so, I need to find a way to remove them from my data set.

In energyReader function fix the average line. Right now it is functioning just 
fine but it has the value of 31 hardcoded (it is meant for September only) in 
it which makes it problematic if you wanna use it for 30-day months.

I removed the septemeber_mean.py from the test/index directory. I no longer need
it.

- The class name was changed from index to EnergyIce.

- I made a few changes to the index.py file. I added the index argument to the 
	energyReader function. Now it can produce the index and the average 
	over the europe. Also, it saves the data (depending index is set to 
	True or False) to two different files named energyIndex and energAverage.

- I also added totalSize attribute. 

- Still need to make sure for the lat = 90.

- I have two versions of the index.py on the stallo server. They are quite 
	similar except a few minor changes to the beginning of each files so 
	that the script can be able to read D and Q files.
- Also added a few minor things to the europeMap function including a new arg 
	called "numberOfMonth". This way the user does not have to manually 
	divide the input data to find the average of the data.
